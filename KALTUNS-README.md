# Jogging Times App

My code was working well with the inital commit code, so i'm using that in this.
There is bug in the code where when a new user signs up. The app won't run due to there not being data availabe to display the jog times. I've there made a hacky solution which requires the user to input 3 jog times for it to start up.
