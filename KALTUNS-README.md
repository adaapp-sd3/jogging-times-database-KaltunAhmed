# Jogging Times App

My code was working well with the inital commit code, so I'm using that.
There is bug in the code where when a new user signs up the app won't run. This is due to there not being data availabe to display the jog times. I've therefore made a hacky solution which requires the user to input 3 jog times before the app can strart
